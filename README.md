### **Prerequisites**
- Portable Version: No pre-requirements - Minimum Nvidia driver version: >=576.57
- Non-Portable Version:
    -   **Git** ([Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
    -   **Miniconda** ([Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download))
        <br> or
    -   **uv** ([Installation choices])(https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

## **Installation Guide (VisoMaster-Fusion)**

### **Portable version**

Download only the Run_Portable.bat file from this repo (you don't need to clone the whole repo) from link below and put it in a new directory were you want to run VisoMaster from. Then just execute the bat file to run VisoMaster. Portable dependencies will be installed on the first run to portable-files directory.
- [Download - Start_Portable.bat](Start_Portable.bat)

You don't need any other steps from below for the portable version. Always start visomaster with Start_Portable.bat

### **Non-Portable - Installation Steps**

**1. Clone the Repository**
Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
```sh
git clone <URL_TO_YOUR_VISOMASTER_FUSION_REPO>
```
```sh
cd VisoMaster
```
```sh
git checkout fusion
```

**2. Create and Activate a python Environment (Skip if you already have one)**


#### In case you like to use "anaconda"

```sh
conda create -n visomaster python=3.11 -y
```
```sh
conda activate visomaster
```
```sh
pip install uv
```

### In case you like to use "uv" directly

```sh
uv venv --python 3.11
```
```sh
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**3. Install requirements**

For a standard setup (including Windows), use:

```sh
uv pip install -r requirements_cu129.txt
```

`requirements_cu129.txt` is now split into:

- `requirements-base.txt` (common runtime/UI dependencies)
- `requirements-cuda-cu129.txt` (CUDA/TensorRT/cuDNN support packages)
- Torch packages (`torch`, `torchvision`, `torchaudio` cu129)

**4. Download required models**
```sh
python download_models.py
```

**5. Run the Application**

Once everything is set up, start the application:
- by opening the **Start.bat** file (for Windows)
or
Activate conda or uv environment in a terminal in the visomaster directory:

```
# If you use Anaconda
conda activate visomaster

# If you use uv only
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Start visomaster
python main.py
```


**5.1 Update to latest code state**
```sh
cd VisoMaster
git pull
```

---

**6. Install ffmpeg**

In Windows - Either via:

- powershell command: "winget install -e --id Gyan.FFmpeg --version 7.1.1"

<br>or

- Download ffmpeg zip: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/packages/ffmpeg-7.1.1-essentials_build.zip
- Unzip it somewhere
- Add "\<unzipped ffmpeg path>\bin" folder to your Windows environment PATH variable

## How to use the Job Manager
1.  Set up your workspace as you normally would before recording (select source/target faces, adjust settings, etc.).
2.  In the Job Manager widget, click the **"Save Job"** button.
3.  Give your job a name. You can also choose whether to use this name for the final output file.
4.  The job will appear in the list. Set up more jobs if you wish.
5.  To process, select one or more jobs and click **"Process Selected"**, or click **"Process All"** to run the entire queue.
6.  Processing will begin automatically. A pop-up will notify you when all jobs are complete.

## Development

- Please use pre-commit before doing git add & commit. And fix found issues before the commit.

  ```
  # Install pre-commit
  uv pip install pre-commit

  # Usage before commits - (run twice in case of found auto corrections)
  pre-commit run --all-files
  ```

## Linux / Runpod / Kasm Quick Start

This is the recommended flow for fresh Linux GPU environments. A new user should only need these commands after cloning the repo:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_linux.sh
bash scripts/run_linux.sh
```

### What was broken before

- Linux users had to piece together multiple install commands, package indexes, and model downloads by hand.
- Lightweight UI/runtime packages could be hidden behind heavyweight CUDA/TensorRT installation failures.
- The old strict cuDNN pin could fail dependency resolution on fresh pods.
- TensorRT availability was hard to diagnose because Python wheels, shared libraries, plugin compatibility, and ONNX Runtime provider state were not summarized in one place.

### What the new flow does

`bash scripts/setup_linux.sh` now:

1. Runs `scripts/preflight_linux.py` first so unsupported Python, missing package indexes, missing Qt system libraries, or unsupported NVIDIA driver/CUDA combinations fail early.
2. Detects Linux, GPU, NVIDIA driver, CUDA runtime, and TensorRT shared-library discoverability before the heavy install starts.
3. Creates or reuses a conda environment named `visomaster` with Python 3.11.
4. Installs `requirements-base.txt` first so PySide6 and other UI/runtime packages are not blocked by CUDA resolver issues.
5. Installs CUDA 12.9 torch wheels from the PyTorch CUDA index and TensorRT/cuDNN packages from the NVIDIA index.
6. Applies the Linux-safe cuDNN compatibility range automatically if an older strict pin is still present.
7. Explicitly installs import-sensitive package names such as `pyqt-toast-notification` and `pyqtdarktheme`.
8. Downloads models automatically.
9. Runs import smoke tests and prints a final summary showing whether TensorRT is available or whether the app will run in CUDA fallback mode.

`bash scripts/run_linux.sh` now:

- Activates the expected conda env.
- Sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `QT_PLUGIN_PATH`, and `QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH` automatically.
- Prints whether the app is launching with TensorRT, CUDA fallback, or CPU fallback.
- Starts `python main.py` cleanly without extra per-session manual setup.

### Linux files involved

- `requirements-base.txt`: common runtime and UI dependencies.
- `requirements-cuda-cu129.txt`: CUDA/TensorRT/cuDNN packages for Linux GPU setups.
- `requirements-dev.txt`: optional developer tools.
- `requirements_cu129.txt`: backward-compatible aggregate file kept for existing Windows/manual workflows.

### Manual commands if you need diagnostics

Fast preflight before install:

```bash
python3 scripts/preflight_linux.py
```

Import smoke test after install:

```bash
python scripts/check_runtime_imports.py
```

Legacy runtime probe:

```bash
bash scripts/validate_linux_gpu_env.sh
```

### TensorRT notes for Linux / Blackwell

- The app validates runtime compatibility at startup and logs the GPU name, driver version, CUDA version, ONNX Runtime providers, TensorRT Python package state, and TensorRT shared-library discovery.
- If TensorRT cannot be made fully functional, the scripts still install the CUDA path and tell you exactly why TensorRT is unavailable.
- The bundled Linux custom plugin `model_assets/libgrid_sample_3d_plugin.so` may still require rebuilding if it was compiled against an older TensorRT ABI such as `libnvinfer.so.8`. In that case, the install and run scripts keep the app usable through CUDA fallback instead of failing late.

### Manual package indexes

If you intentionally bypass `scripts/setup_linux.sh`, you still need these indexes:

- Torch CUDA 12.9 wheels: `--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu129`
- NVIDIA packages: `--extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com`
- PyPI base packages: `--index-url https://pypi.org/simple`

## **Troubleshooting**
- If you face CUDA-related issues, ensure your GPU drivers are up to date.
- For missing models, double-check that all models are placed in the correct directories.
